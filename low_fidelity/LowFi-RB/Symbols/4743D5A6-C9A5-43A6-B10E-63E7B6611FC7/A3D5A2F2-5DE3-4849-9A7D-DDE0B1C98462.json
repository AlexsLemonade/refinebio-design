We aimed to investigate changes in gene expression in the very early phase after adalimumab treatment. Paired punch biopsies from 10 psoriasis patients were obtained before and four and 14 days after treatment start. RNA was isolated using the Promega SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega, Madison, USA) and a total of 100 ng RNA was analysed by the Human Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). All array data processing and analysis were performed in R version 3.1.2 (2014-10-31)."
